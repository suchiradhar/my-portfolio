My journey in design spans startups, multinationals, and the tech-driven world of AI, where I've contributed to building compelling brand identities and seamless digital experiences.

            As a student ambassador at UL, I enjoy connecting with people, sharing insights, and inspiring others to pursue their creative ambitions. Outside the world of design, I love exploring museums, rowing, music and capturing moments of daily life. I enjoy writing poetry, journalling and learning about personal growth and balance. 
            This portfolio reflects not only my skills but also my passion for innovation and storytelling through design. Itâ€™s my way of showing how creativity and technology can work together to create meaningful impacts.
